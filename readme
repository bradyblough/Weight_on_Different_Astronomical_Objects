This script takes in a weight and outputs the weight on different astronomical bodies.


First, we need to calculate the mass of the body given the inputted weight. To do this, we divide the inputted weight by
Earth's gravitational acceleration. Then we can multiply the user's mass by the gravitational acceleration of whatever astronomical
object we want to calculate the new weight for.

Example:
If we wanted to calculate the user's weight on Mars, we would do the following:
user's weight on Earth = 100 lbs
user's mass on Earth = user's weight on Earth (100) / Earth gravitational acceleration (9.8)
user's weight on Mars = user's mass on earth (10.2) * Mars' gravitational acceleration (3.7)
user's weight on Mars (rounded) = 38 lbs
